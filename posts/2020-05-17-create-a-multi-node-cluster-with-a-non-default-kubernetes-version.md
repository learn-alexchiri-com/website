Detailed instructions shown in the recording can be found in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/alexchiri/5791c93eaf31f53ad865336fa09527ba).

The instructions in this tutorial can be run on any kind installation. If you don't have kind installed, I show how to get started with kind and Docker in a WSL2 Ubuntu 18 on Windows 10 in a [separate video]().
